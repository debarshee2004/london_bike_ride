# LONDON BIKE RIDES DATASETðŸš²

## Overview

This data visualization project aims to explore and visualize the London Bike Sharing dataset using Tableau. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle ([London Bike Sharing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)), contains information about bike rentals in London, including details such as timestamp, weather conditions, and the number of bikes rented.

## Dataset Overview

The London Bike Sharing dataset provides the following key information:

- **timestamp**: Date and time of the bike rental record.
- **cnt**: The count of bikes rented at that timestamp.
- **t1, t2, hum, wind_speed, weather_code, is_holiday, is_weekend**: Various weather and holiday-related parameters affecting bike rentals.

For a detailed description of each column, refer to the [dataset documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset).
